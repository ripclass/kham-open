# KhaM – A Cultural Memory Engine for South Asian AI

KhaM is an open-source project preserving the **emotional nuance**, **dialectal memory**, and **cultural context** of South Asian languages for use in AI systems.

It’s not a translation tool.  
It’s a **memory engine**—designed to make AI speak like your people, not like a textbook.

---

## 🌏 Why KhaM?

Most AI speaks in generic, Westernized tones.  
KhaM gives AI a soul—so Bhooter Raja sounds like your grandfather, not like Google Translate.

We’re capturing:

- Dialectal expressions (Chatgaya, Sylheti, Bhojpuri, Tamil, etc.)
- Emotionally-tagged prompts
- Voice memory (how people actually sound)
- Cultural context for AI agents (tone, rhythm, intent)

---

## 🔧 How It Works

KhaM is modular. Each dialect/persona includes:

- Prompt examples
- Emotion tags
- Idiomatic phrases
- Suggested usage for AI agents

Developers can plug these into LLMs (GPT, Claude, Mistral) to create more human-like assistants.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

We’re just getting started. You can help by:

- Submitting voice samples (coming soon)
- Adding idioms and tone rules for your dialect
- Translating sample prompts with emotional nuance
- Reviewing prompt structure

Start by opening an issue or contributing to `/prompts/`.

---

## 🛠 Coming Soon

- Voice-to-emotion tagging layer (`/whispered/`)
- Dialect contribution spec
- KhaM API playground
- Public data collection portal

---

## 💌 Why "KhaM"?

In Bangla, *Khaam* means "envelope."  
This is our envelope for the forgotten voices of South Asia—unopened, unspoken, unpreserved until now.
